    Make a list of five or more usernames, including the name 'admin'. 
    Imagine you are writing code that will print a greeting to each user 
    after they log in to a website. Loop through the list, and print a greeting 
    to each user:

   Make a list of five or more usernames called current_users.
   Make another list of five usernames called new_users. Make sure one or two of the new usernames are also in the 
   current_users list. 

   Loop through the new_users list to see if each new username has already been used. 
   If it has, print a message that the person will need to enter a new username. If a username has not been used, 
   print a message saying that the username is available. Make sure your comparison is case insensitive. 
   If 'John' has been used, 'JOHN' should not be accepted. (To do this, youâ€™ll need to make a copy of current_users 
   containing the lowercase versions of all existing users.)
